# React-Web-portfolio

This is what my code looks like with personal information redacted of course. As well as the excess backage from the code such as the 
random libraries like Framer which were downloaded but not used on anything in this project. The same for the two font types Used for the 
body tags as well as the introduction text. 

the inspiration for this work is drawn from Slodobans tutorial on a React.js Webportfolio.
